Word 2016: Getting Started with Word
====================================

56685383aaa9170d6ccc7ddb 5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9

#### Lesson 1: Getting Started with Word

### Introduction

Microsoft Word 2016 is a **word processing** application that allows you to create a variety of **documents**, including letters, resumes, and more. In this lesson, you'll learn how to navigate the Word interface and become familiar with some of its most important features, such as the **Ribbon**, **Quick Access Toolbar**, and **Backstage view**.

Watch the video below to become more familiar with Word 2016.  

<span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span>

#### Getting to know Word 2016

**Word 2016** is similar to Word 2013 and Word 2010. If you've previously used either version, then Word 2016 should feel familiar. But if you are new to Word or have more experience with older versions, you should first take some time to become familiar with the **Word 2016 interface**.

#### The Word interface

When you open Word for the first time, the **Start Screen** will appear. From here, you'll be able to create a **new document**, choose a **template**, and access your **recently edited documents**. From the **Start Screen**, locate and select **Blank document** to access the Word interface.

![creating a new blank document](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/create_new_blank.png)

Click the buttons in the interactive below to learn more about the Word interface:

Microsoft Account
-----------------

From here, you can access your **Microsoft account** information, view your profile, and switch accounts.  

Tell Me
-------

The **Tell me** bar allows you to search for commands, which is especially helpful if you don't remember where to find a specific command.  

Command Group
-------------

Each group contains a series of different **commands**. Simply click any command to apply it. Some groups also have an **arrow** in the bottom-right corner, which you can click to see even more commands.  

Quick Access Toolbar
--------------------

The **Quick Access Toolbar** lets you access common commands no matter which tab is selected. By default, it includes the **Save**, **Undo**, and **Redo** commands.

The Ruler
---------

The **Ruler** is located at the top and to the left of your document. It makes it easier to make **alignment** and **spacing adjustments**.  

Scroll Bar
----------

Click and drag the **vertical scroll bar** to move up and down through the pages of your document.  

Zoom Control
------------

Click and drag the slider to use the zoom control. The number to the right of the slider bar reflects the **zoom percentage**.  

Document Views
--------------

There are three ways to view a document:  
  
**Read Mode** displays your document in full-screen mode.  
**  
Print Layout** is selected by default. It shows the document as it would appear on the printed page.**Web Layout** shows how your document would look as a webpage.

The Ribbon
----------

The **Ribbon** contains all of the **commands** you will need to perform common tasks in Word. It has multiple **tabs**, each with several **groups** of commands.  

Document Pane
-------------

This is where you'll **type and edit text** in the document.  

Page and Word Count
-------------------

From here, you can quickly see the number of **words** and **pages** in your document.

Zoom Control
------------

Click and drag the slider to use the zoom control. The number to the right of the slider bar reflects the **zoom percentage**.

### Working with the Word environment

Like other recent versions, Word 2016 continues to use features like the **Ribbon** and the **Quick Access Toolbar**—where you will find commands to perform common tasks in Word—as well as **Backstage view**.

### The Ribbon

Word uses a **tabbed Ribbon system** instead of traditional menus. The **Ribbon** contains **multiple tabs**, which you can find near the top of the Word window.

![tabs on the Ribbon](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_ribbon_tabs.png)

Each tab contains several **groups of related commands**. For example, the Font group on the Home tab contains commands for formatting text in your document.

![the Font group on the Home tab](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_ribbon_group.png)

Some groups also have a **small arrow** in the bottom-right corner that you can click for even more options.

![clicking the arrow to see more group commands](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_ribbon_arrow.png)

#### Showing and hiding the Ribbon

If you find that the Ribbon takes up too much screen space, you can hide it. To do this, click the **Ribbon Display Options** arrow in the upper-right corner of the Ribbon, then select the desired option from the drop-down menu:

![hiding the Ribbon](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_ribbon_minimize.png)

*   **Auto-hide Ribbon**: Auto-hide displays your document in full-screen mode and completely hides the Ribbon from view. To show the Ribbon, click the **Expand Ribbon** command at the top of screen.
*   **Show Tabs**: This option hides all command groups when they're not in use, but tabs will remain visible. To show the Ribbon, simply click a tab.
*   **Show Tabs and Commands:** This option maximizes the Ribbon. All of the tabs and commands will be visible. This option is selected by default when you open Word for the first time.

To learn how to add **custom tabs** and **commands** to the Ribbon, review our Extra on [Customizing the Ribbon](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/word2013/customizing-the-ribbon/1/).

#### Using the Tell me feature

If you're having trouble finding command you want, the **Tell Me** feature can help. It works just like a regular search bar: Type what you're looking for, and a list of options will appear. You can then use the command directly from the menu without having to find it on the Ribbon.

![searching for commands with the Tell Me feature](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_ribbon_tellme.png)

### The Quick Access Toolbar

Located just above the Ribbon, the **Quick Access Toolbar** lets you access common commands no matter which tab is selected. By default, it shows the **Save**, **Undo**, and **Redo** commands, but you can add other commands depending on your needs.

#### To add commands to the Quick Access Toolbar:

1.  Click the **drop-down arrow** to the right of the **Quick Access Toolbar**.
    
    ![clicking the Quick Access Toolbar drop-down menu](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_quick_start.png)
    
2.  Select the **command** you want to add from the menu.
    
    ![adding the Quick Print command to the Quick Access Toolbar](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_quick_print.png)
    
3.  The command will be **added** to the Quick Access Toolbar.
    
    ![the Quick Print command on the Quick Access Toolbar](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_quick_done.png)
    

### The Ruler

The **R****uler** is located at the top and to the left of your document. It makes it easier to **adjust** your document with precision. If you want, you can hide the Ruler to create more screen space.

#### To show or hide the Ruler:

1.  Click the **View** tab.
    
    ![clicking the View tab](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_ruler_tab.png)
    
2.  Click the checkbox next to **Ruler** to **show** or **hide** the Ruler.
    
    ![turning on the Ruler](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_ruler_done.png)
    

### Backstage view

**Backstage view** gives you various options for saving, opening a file, printing, and sharing your document. To access Backstage view, click the **File** tab on the **Ribbon**.  

![clicking the File tab](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_backstage_file.png)

### Document views and zooming

Word has a variety of viewing options that change how your document is displayed. You can choose to view your document in **Read Mode**, **Print Layout**, or **Web Layout**. These views can be useful for various tasks, especially if you're planning to **print** the document. You can also **zoom in and out** to make your document easier to read.

#### Switching document views

Switching between different document views is easy. Just locate and select the desired **document view command** in the bottom-right corner of the Word window.

*   **Read Mode**: This view opens the document to a full screen. This view is great for reading large amounts of text or simply reviewing your work.
    
    ![read mode](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5690213b4ba91213b0054eb9_01_08_2016/start_view_read.png)
    
*   **Print Layout**: This is the default document view in Word. It shows what the document will look like on the printed page.

To zoom in or out, click and drag the **zoom control slider** in the bottom-right corner of the Word window. You can also select the **+** or **\-** **commands** to zoom in or out by smaller increments. The number next to the slider displays the current **zoom percentage**, also called the **zoom level**.
